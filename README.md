> Nao app "Tell me a story".

I am trying to make Nao tell a story like a parent would do to its child. The main goal of the project is to make the voice of NAO feel like natural through the tone of his voice.

There already is a similar app in the AskNao ($$$) program but the voice is pretty linear and sometimes it's hard to understand what the robot says. I guess it could even be incomprehensible for someone with hearing problem or a foreigner.
