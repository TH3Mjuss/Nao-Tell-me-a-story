# Nao-Tell-me-a-story
Nao app "Tell me a story".

I am trying to make Nao tell a story like a parent would do to its child. The main goal of the project is to make the voice of NAO feel like natural through the tone of his voice. Once this is done, I will make Nao move in agrement to what he says, to make it even more alive.

There already is similar app in the AskNao program but the voice is pretty linear and sometimes it is even hard to understand what the robot says. I guess it could even be incomprehensible for someone with hearing problem or a foreigner.

The project is not very complicated technically, it is just a lot of work to make every sentences sound as we want it to.

## Install notes
### The Python way
First change the IP adress in the code to the one given by your robot.
THen run the the python script in /src/ by running the following commands in yout terminal: 
    
    chmod +x Le\ vieux\ grand-père.py
    ./Le\ vieux\ grand-père.py
